<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a natural at art. I have been artistic since I was a baby. I am also
  gifted at math. I have a variety of experiences that have contributed to my
  talents. One example is I received a high A in PLTW Introduction to
  Engineering Design class in 9th grade. I took this class because I wanted to
  have a better understanding of how the functionality of objects impacts how
  they look in the 3d-space. At the end of this class, I became a certified
  Autodesk user.
